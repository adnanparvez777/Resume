    <h1>FREELY WE RECEIVE, FREELY WE GIVE</h1>
    <p>Our heart is to bless people with Hindi worship songs. Freely we have received our ministry and freely we want to give our music.
    <BR> However, production involves costs so we would like you to partner with us…. Feel free to give!</p>
<H1>WHY GIVE?</H1>
<p>Because we want to bless a lot more people with many more songs. We receive countless messages of people who have been blessed by our songs and they ask us how they can be a part of the ministry, well this is the best way! By giving you’ll not only enable us to produce more worship songs, you’ll also make them 
available for free to many people who need to hear the gospel through music. By you blessing us we can be a blessing to many others!</p>
